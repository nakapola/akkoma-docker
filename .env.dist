#### Akkoma build settings

# akkoma tag, commit, or branch to build
# AKKOMA_VERSION=v3.9.3

# akkoma's mix environment.
# You should leave this at prod unless you know what you're doing.
# MIX_ENV=prod

# The uid/gid used by akkoma.
# You should probably set this to the same
# uid/guid that cloned the akkoma-docker repo.
# This way modding akkoma becomes a lot easier.

# The git repo where akkoma's sources are located.
# This will be used at build-time and to resolve AKKOMA_VERSION via "git ls-remote".
# The latter involves one connection per "manage.sh build" execution, even if a rebuild does not occur.
#
# You might want to change this if you're working on a fork,
# or if you do not trust the admins of akkoma's Gitlab instance.
